# Movie-Recommendation-System

Building a recommendation system in Python is a powerful way to offer personalized recommendations to users. These systems have a wide range of applications from recommending products on e-commerce websites to suggesting movies on streaming platforms. Over time as more data is collected these systems can become even more accurate offering better tailored experiences to users.

- Developed a recommendation system using collaborative filtering (user-based & item-based) and content-based filtering. Implemented machine learning models using Scikit-learn for similarity calculations and predictions.
